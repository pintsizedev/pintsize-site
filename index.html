            <p>
                My name is Daniel Burnley and I am an undergraduate at the University of Kent studying Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently in my second year of university and in my spare time I am enjoying undergoing my own personal projects (Which can be found on my 'projects' page).
            </p>
            <p>
                I have several interests in the area of computing, including games programming, and web development (both front-end and back-end). I've been learning to program for about 5 years now, starting with Python which I taught myself in my spare time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also have an interest in the hardware side of computing, and have experimented a little with Arduinos and taught Year 8 pupils how to use them, as well as having built my own (and several other) computer.
